## Who's Aaron
I'm Aaron, a PhD student in environmental economics. This site is an attempt to communicate some things about me that would help a potential partner know if we'd be a good match. No need to read all this stuff, but if your interest is piqued, swipe right and let me know which parts you find interesting!
  
### My Mission in Life
Currently, my main goal is to use my lifeforce as efficeiently and joyously as possible to make the world a better place. I strive to use science and math (via economics) to help desribe our world's problems and test different solutions. Thoughout my life, I want to work with others and help build a community to make substaintial change in the world.

### Romantic Philosophy
Long term, I'm looking for a partner to adventure with and strategically build our careers together. This most likely falls on the monogamous side of the specturum and I think I crave a copilot that I can build long term trust and plans with. I'm pretty flexible with how monogamous a relationship is, but if I were to estimate, it's about a 82.7% probability that my long term relationship will be farily monomagmous with some room for romantic exploration.

Short term, I'm convinced that successful dating is probably a numbers game. I'm first looking for people that I'm compatible with on paper and then hoping to have a couple dates so we can see if we jive in person. I think it's likely that most dates don't end in a relationship, but I am excited to be as genuine, kind, and romantic as possible. I'm definitely also looking for friends that are interested in making the world a better place and having endless conversations about abstract topics.

### My Passions
Our universe is a beautiful place, full of wonder and mystery. As scientists, we seek to understand the world, predict its behavior, and hopefully use that information to make the world work better. My main passions in life are
- Science and science communication
- Policy evaluation and politics
- Nature / the universe
- Improving the world in practical and efficient ways
    
### Curiosity
If I had to choose a word to describe myself, it would be curiousity. I want to know more; more about the world, more about myself, more about what makes things work the way they do. 
    
### What I'm looking for in a partner
Activities that I find exciting and desirable:
- someone I can turn to in bed and ask about linear algebra or mathematical models of the world or something super nerdy like that.
- climbing trees, scuttling around on rocks, running up rivers. Exploring and examing the world together and sharing insights.
- cooking and excercising together; practicing new skills together.

### Religious views
I grew up christian and strongly identified with christianity when I was younger, but I'd say I'm closer to agnostic now. The defniition of god that makes the most sense to me is god = creation; that is, my universal translator converts "God" to "the forces that push and pull particles and affect waves" whenever I am conversing with other humaniods about some type of motivating factor for life and the universe.
    
### Intellectual topics I love to discuss
- Real Analysis, Linear Algebra
- Graduate level statistics
- Probability Theory
- Economic and Econometric Theory
- Physics and Computer Science
- The eventual takeover by our benevolent AI overlords

### Sex & Intimacy 
I am happy to chat about this given that it's an integral part of a relationship for most folks. Since I'm not sure how confidential this site will stay, I'll just say: in intimate settings, I have a lot of experience playing the dominant role, but I'm excited to keep exploring different ways of being intimate with future partners. I'll leave the rest for private converstations :P

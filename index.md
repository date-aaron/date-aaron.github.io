## A little about me
I'm Aaron, a PhD student in environmental economics. This site is an attempt to communicate some things about me that would help a potential romantic partner know if we'd be a good match. No need to read all this stuff, but if your interest is piqued, swipe right and let me know which parts you find interesting!

### My mission in life
Currently, my main goal is to use my lifeforce as efficiently and joyously as possible to make the world a better place. I strive to use science and math (via economics) to help desribe our world's problems and test different solutions; in particular, around climate change and issues of environmental justice. Thoughout my life, I want to work with others and help build a community to make substantial change in the world.

### My passions
Our universe is a beautiful place, full of wonder and mystery. It's also full of systems that oppress some and benefit others. As a scientist, I seek to understand the world through models and data and hopefully use that information to make the world work better for everyone. My main passions in life are:
- Science, science communication, and science collaboration
- Policy evaluation and politics
- Nature / the universe
- Improving the world in practical and efficient ways

### What I'm looking for in a partner
Activities that I find exciting and desirable:
- someone I can turn to in bed and ask about linear algebra or mathematical models of the world or something super nerdy like that.
- climbing trees, scuttling around on rocks, running up rivers. Exploring and examining the world together and sharing insights.
- cooking and exercising together; practicing new skills together. I love the idea of being on a team tackling things together.

### Religious views
I grew up Christian and strongly identified with Christianity when I was younger, but I'm fairly agnostic now. The defniition of god that makes the most sense to me is god = creation; that is, my universal translator converts *God* to *the observable and unobservable forces that bind atoms and communicate information through space* whenever I am conversing with other humaniods about some type of motivating factor for life and the universe. I understand that religion is often used in ways that oppress people, but I also bel
    
### Intellectual topics I love to discuss
- Real Analysis, Linear Algebra
- Graduate level Statistics
- Probability Theory
- Economic and Econometric Theory
- Physics and Computer Science
- Gender and Sexuality
- The eventual takeover by our benevolent AI overlords
- Politics

### Activities you can find me doing
- lots of math, lots of`computer programming`
- DIY home projects (building shelves, installing wall outlets, fixing hot tubs)
- hiking and camping: I love both light outdoorsy stuff and pretty substantial trips (backpacking, etc). I don't have a lot of practice with more challenging outdoor activities but would love to get more experience!
- cuddling, cooking, being awkwardly kind to strangers
- trying to find someone to watch a documentary with me

### Romantic philosophy
Long term, I'm looking for a partner to adventure with and strategically build our careers together. This most likely falls on the monogamous side of the specturum and I think I crave a copilot that I can build long term trust and plans with. I'm pretty flexible with how monogamous a relationship is, but if I were to estimate, it's about a 82.7% probability that my long term relationship will be farily monogamous with some room for romantic exploration.

Short term, I'm convinced that successful dating is probably a numbers game. I'm first looking for someone that I'm compatible with on paper and then hoping to have a couple dates to see if we jive in person. I think it's likely that most dates don't end in a relationship, but I am excited to be as genuine, kind, and romantic as possible regardless of the outcome. I'm definitely also looking for friends that are interested in making the world a better place and having endless conversations about abstract topics (adventure buds, too). I don't see any interaction with another cool brain as a waste and hope to keep in touch with people that are compatible in some way.

### Family & children
I value a positive relationship with family, though I recognize there are many people out there for whom it may not be possible or healthy to develop/maintain a positive family relationship. My relationship with my family has not always been good but in recent years I've tried hard to develop something meaningful. I don't spend much time with my family but I do care about them.

I love kids! I think children are just way cooler than most adults because they are curious and have a much higher capacity to learn and discuss. I'm not sure yet if I want kids of my own (TBD with a partner), but I hope to be a supportive guncle to my siblings and friend's children.

### Sex & intimacy 
I am happy to chat about this given that it's an integral part of a relationship for most folx. Since I'm not sure how confidential this site will stay, I'll just say: in intimate settings, I have a lot of experience playing the dominant role, but I'm excited to keep exploring different ways of being intimate with future partners. I'll leave the rest for private converstations :P

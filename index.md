## A little about me
I'm Aaron, a PhD student in environmental economics. This site is an attempt to communicate some things about me that would help a potential romantic partner know if we'd be a good match. No need to read all this stuff, but if your interest is piqued, swipe right and let me know which parts you find interesting!

### My Mission in Life
Currently, my main goal is to use my lifeforce as efficiently and joyously as possible to make the world a better place. I strive to use science and math (via economics) to help desribe our world's problems and test different solutions; in particular, around climate change and issues of environmental justice. Thoughout my life, I want to work with others and help build a community to make substantial change in the world.

### My Passions
Our universe is a beautiful place, full of wonder and mystery. As scientists, we seek to understand the world, predict its behavior, and hopefully use that information to make the world work better. My main passions in life are
- Science, science communication, and science collaboration
- Policy evaluation and politics
- Nature / the universe
- Improving the world in practical and efficient ways

### What I'm looking for in a partner
Activities that I find exciting and desirable:
- someone I can turn to in bed and ask about linear algebra or mathematical models of the world or something super nerdy like that.
- climbing trees, scuttling around on rocks, running up rivers. Exploring and examing the world together and sharing insights.
- cooking and excercising together; practicing new skills together. I love the idea of being on a team tackling things together.

### Religious views
I grew up christian and strongly identified with christianity when I was younger, but I'd say I'm closer to agnostic now. The defniition of god that makes the most sense to me is god = creation; that is, my universal translator converts ***God*** to ***the observable and unobservable forces that bind atoms and communicate information through space*** whenever I am conversing with other humaniods about some type of motivating factor for life and the universe.
    
### Intellectual topics I love to discuss
- Real Analysis, Linear Algebra
- Graduate level statistics
- Probability Theory
- Economic and Econometric Theory
- Physics and Computer Science
- Gender and sexuality
- The eventual takeover by our benevolent AI overlords
- Politics

### Activities you can find me doing
- lots of math, lots of `computer programming`
- DIY home projects (building shelves, installing wall outlets, fixing hottubs)
- hiking and camping: I love both light outdoorsy stuff and pretty substantial (backpacking trips, etc). I don't have a lot of practice at the more challenging outdoor activities, but would love to get more experience!
- cuddling, cooking, being awkwardly kind to strangers
- trying to find someone to watch a documentary with me

### Romantic Philosophy
Long term, I'm looking for a partner to adventure with and strategically build our careers together. This most likely falls on the monogamous side of the specturum and I think I crave a copilot that I can build long term trust and plans with. I'm pretty flexible with how monogamous a relationship is, but if I were to estimate, it's about a 82.7% probability that my long term relationship will be farily monogamous with some room for romantic exploration.

Short term, I'm convinced that successful dating is probably a numbers game. I'm first looking for someone that I'm compatible with on paper and then hoping to have a couple dates to see if we jive in person. I think it's likely that most dates don't end in a relationship, but I am excited to be as genuine, kind, and romantic as possible regardless of the outcome. I'm definitely also looking for friends that are interested in making the world a better place and having endless conversations about abstract topics. I don't see any interaction with another cool brain as a waste and hope to keep in touch with people that are compatible in some way.

### Family & Children
I value a positive relationship with family if possible, though I recognize there are many queer people out there for whom it is not possible or healthy to try to develop a positive family relationship. My relationship with my family has not always been good, but in recent years I've tried hard to develop something meaningful. I don't rely on my family but I do care about them.

I love kids! I think children are just way cooler than most adults because they are curious and have a much higher capacity to learn and discuss. I'm not sure yet if I want kids of my own (TBD with a partner), but I hope to be a supportive guncle to my siblings and friend's children.

### Sex & Intimacy 
I am happy to chat about this given that it's an integral part of a relationship for most folks. Since I'm not sure how confidential this site will stay, I'll just say: in intimate settings, I have a lot of experience playing the dominant role, but I'm excited to keep exploring different ways of being intimate with future partners. I'll leave the rest for private converstations :P
